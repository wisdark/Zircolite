![](pics/Zircolite.svg)

**Zircolite is a standalone tool written in Python 3. It allows to use SIGMA rules on MS Windows EVTX (EVTX and JSONL format), Auditd logs and Sysmon for Linux logs**

- **Zircolite** can be used directly on the investigated endpoint or in your forensic/detection lab
- **Zircolite** is relatively fast and can parse large datasets in just seconds (check [benchmarks](docs/Internals.md#benchmarks))
- **Zircolite** is based on a Sigma backend (SQLite) and do not use internal sigma to "something" conversion
- **Zircolite** can export results to multiple format with using Jinja [templates](templates) : JSON, CSV, JSONL, Splunk, Elastic, Zinc, Timesketch...

**Zircolite can be used directly in Python or you can use the binaries provided in [releases](https://github.com/wagga40/Zircolite/releases).** 
**Documentation is [here](docs).**

## Requirements / Installation

You can install dependencies with : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

The use of [evtx_dump](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx) is **optional but required by default (because it is for now much faster)**, If you do not want to use it you have to use the `--noexternal` option. The tool is provided if you clone the Zircolite repository (the official repository is [here](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx)). For Apple M1 computers, the `--noexternal` option is preferred.

## Quick start

#### EVTX files : 

Help is available with `zircolite.py -h`. If your EVTX files have the extension ".evtx" :

```shell
# python3 zircolite.py --evtx <EVTX FOLDER or EVTX FILE> --ruleset <SIGMA RULESET> [--ruleset <OTHER RULESET>]
python3 zircolite.py --evtx sysmon.evtx --ruleset rules/rules_windows_sysmon.json
```

The SYSMON ruleset used here is a default one and is for logs coming from endpoints where SYSMON is installed. 

Rules can be updated using the `-U` or `--update-rules` options.

#### Auditd / Sysmon for Linux / JSONL or NDJSON logs : 

```shell
python3 zircolite.py --events auditd.log --ruleset rules/rules_linux.json --auditd
python3 zircolite.py --events sysmon.log --ruleset rules/rules_linux.json --sysmon4linux
python3 zircolite.py --events <JSON_FOLDER or JSON_FILE> --ruleset rules/rules_windows_sysmon.json --jsononly
```

:information_source: If you want to try the tool you can test with [EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES) (EVTX Files).

## Docs

Everything is [here](docs).

## Mini-Gui

The Mini-GUI can be used totally offline, it allows the user to display and search results. You can automatically generate a Mini-Gui "package" with the `--package` option. To know how to use the Mini-GUI, check docs [here](docs/Advanced.md#mini-gui).

## Battle-tested

Zircolite has been used to perform cold-analysis (in Lab) on EVTX in multiple "real-life" situations. 
However, even if Zircolite has been used many times to perform analysis directly on a Microsoft Windows endpoint, there is not yet a pipeline to thoroughly test every release.
